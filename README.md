# Craft Brewery Inventory & Batch Tracker

A lightweight vertical SaaS prototype focused on a niche often underserved by generic inventory tools: independent craft breweries.

## What it does

- Tracks key brew ingredients (malt, hops, yeast, adjuncts)
- Flags low-stock ingredients using reorder thresholds
- Logs brewing batches and automatically deducts ingredient usage from inventory
- Provides an operational snapshot suitable for small brewery teams

## Run locally

Open `index.html` directly in a modern browser, or serve the folder:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 4173
```

Then visit `http://localhost:4173`.
